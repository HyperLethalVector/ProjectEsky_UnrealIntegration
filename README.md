# ProjectEsky_UnrealIntegration

This is experimental, and still a work in progress.

What is missing:

- MRTK Integration

How to use:

- Clone project
- Open Config/DataConfig.json and update your v2 render float variables, and set your display offsets, as well as your leapmotion tracker and camera rig offsets
- Open in unreal
- The 'Test Map' within the Esky plugin's content is your go to default scene setup, alternatively just drag a 'NSRig' actor from the esky content folder into the scene
- Hit play, have fun!

Limitations:

- Only works with 'play in editor', does not work with standalone PIE or on external build... yet!
